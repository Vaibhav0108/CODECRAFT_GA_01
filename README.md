# GPT-2 Text Generation

This project fine-tunes OpenAI's GPT-2 model using a custom dataset to generate human-like text.

## 📁 Files
- `data/my_dataset.txt`: The dataset used for training
- `notebooks/fine_tune_gpt2.ipynb`: Colab notebook for training (to be added)
- `outputs/sample_outputs.txt`: Example generated text (to be added)
- `models/`: Folder for storing trained model files

## 🔧 Instructions
1. Upload your dataset to Colab or mount Google Drive.
2. Open the training notebook in `/notebooks/`.
3. Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your dataset.
4. Generate sample outputs and evaluate them.
5. Save your best model and push to GitHub.

## 🧠 Generation Methods
Uses top-p sampling, greedy decoding, and temperature control.

## 🧰 Dependencies
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
